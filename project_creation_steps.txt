# Project Creation Steps

## Frontend
1. Set up the frontend environment using Vite.
2. Create the main entry point in `src/main.jsx`.
3. Develop the main application component in `src/App.jsx`.
4. Style the application using CSS in `src/App.css` and `src/index.css`.
5. Implement routing and state management as needed.

## Backend
1. Set up the backend environment using Node.js and Express.
2. Create the main entry point in `index.js`.
3. Configure the database connection in `config/db.config.js`.
4. Define the user model and create the users table in `models/users.model.js`.
5. Implement authentication logic in `controllers/auth.controller.js`.
6. Set up routes for authentication in `routes/auth.routes.js`.

## APIs
1. Define API endpoints for user registration, login, and logout.
2. Implement input validation and error handling in the controller functions.
3. Use JWT for authentication and authorization.
4. Test the API endpoints using Postman or similar tools.

## Database
1. Set up the MySQL database and create the necessary tables.
2. Use environment variables to manage database credentials securely.
3. Implement database queries in the model files.

## Testing
1. Write unit tests for the backend logic using a testing framework like Jest.
2. Test the frontend components using a testing library like React Testing Library.
3. Perform integration testing for the API endpoints.

## Deployment
1. Prepare the application for deployment by building the frontend assets.
2. Deploy the backend to a cloud service or server.
3. Ensure the database is accessible and properly configured in the production environment.
