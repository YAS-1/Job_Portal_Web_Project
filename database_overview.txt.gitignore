# Database Overview and Next Steps

## Current Setup
- The MySQL database connection is configured in `config/db.config.js`.
- The `users` table is created in `models/users.model.js` if it does not already exist.

## Next Steps
1. **Create Additional Tables**:
   - If your application requires more tables (e.g., for job postings, applications, etc.), define the SQL queries in new model files similar to `users.model.js`.

2. **Implement Database Queries**:
   - Add functions in your model files to handle CRUD operations for the `users` table and any additional tables you create.
   - Example functions could include:
     - `getUserById(id)`
     - `updateUser(id, data)`
     - `deleteUser(id)`

3. **Testing Database Queries**:
   - Write unit tests for your database queries to ensure they work as expected.
   - Use Jest or another testing framework to create tests for your model functions.

4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Ensure that your `.env` file contains the correct database credentials:
     ```
     HOST=your_database_host
     USER=your_database_user
     PASSWORD=your_database_password
     PORT=your_database_port
     DATABASE=your_database_name
     ```

5. **Database Migration**:
   - Consider using a migration tool (like Sequelize or Knex) for managing database schema changes in a more structured way.

## Conclusion
You are now set to work on the database section of your project. If you need assistance with specific queries or table structures, feel free to ask!
